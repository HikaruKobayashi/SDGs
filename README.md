Portfolio
=========

This repository is a my first Portfolio.
I'm aiming for fun creating and I want you to have fun. 

This is a Web site which is about SDGs.
SDGs is a issues to be addressed around the world but it is very low recognition in Japan.

For that reasen, I create this site why is to get many people to knowã€€about SDGs.

Let's think about these challenges together!
